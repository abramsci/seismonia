Seism on IA. Seism-onIa. Se is mon ia.
Not much deep thought in the name - just needed to call it somehow and all the obvious combinations are already taken.

In the age of ubiquitous artificial intelligence usage (AI) someone needs to feed all these networks and models with high-quality datasets. In many domains such a dreary reality may be significantly lighened up by the opposing abbreviation - intelligent automation (IA). This tool specifically is aimed to slightly balance the situaltion in seismology where recent tectonic shift to AI heavily overshadowed good old IA approaches (<= subjective author opinion).

This, first of all, is an attempt to learn awesome Rust programming language and highly-promising Bevy game engine. Secondary objective for now is to make the frame of a cross-platform app for intelligent automation of a rather crucial task in the seismological workflow - initial identification (and labeling) of various (natural) events on long (up to several mounths) continous seismograms.

To add even more spice - with the exception of testing on other platforms I plan to primaliry develop it on the Steam Deck :wink: :wink:
